##### Hey peeps! I'm 
### PRAVEEN!
I have a full name, _N Praveen Chandhar_, but you can call me Praveen, or **PC** in short.
Let me tell about meself a bit here:- 
* I like playing the keys, the strings, listening to music. I have spent a part of my lifetime there. 
* My hobbies include chess, cubing and a lot of other things.
* I am a die hard GoT fan. 


Markdown is by far the best word styler I have seen so far, it saves a lot of time and human effort. 
1. You do not need to goof around looking for buttons like bold, itallic etc. You have them on your keyboard
1. Typing the text in a black console gives the "hackerman" effect.

Looking for forward a wonderful learning experience in the spider inductions process.

As Jaime Lannister once said (*in Season 03*):-
